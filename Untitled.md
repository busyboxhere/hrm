    - **Technology Stack:**
        - Backend: Spring Boot (Java), Spring Data JPA (Hibernate), Spring Security, REST APIs
        - Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
        - Frontend (Optional for later integration): Angular or React for UI
        - Build tools: Maven or Gradle
        - Testing: JUnit, Mockito
        - Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, or AWS/Heroku for cloud deployment
    - **Design Database Schema:** Outline entity relationships (e.g., Employee, Department, Role, Attendance, Payroll).

### **Phase 2: Project Setup and Basic Architecture**

- **Objective:** Set up a solid foundation for the application with modular and scalable architecture.
- **Tasks:**
    - **Spring Boot Initialization:** Use Spring Initializr to generate the project. Add necessary dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Spring Security, etc.
    - **Setup Database:** Configure database connections and initialize the schema for Employee, Department, Roles, etc.
    - **Entity Relationships:** Define entity models for core components (Employee, Department, Role, etc.) and relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-One).
    - **Basic Controllers:** Create REST controllers for basic Employee CRUD operations.
    - **Service Layer:** Implement service classes to handle business logic.
    - **Repository Layer:** Use Spring Data JPA to create repository interfaces.
    - **Security Configuration:** Set up Spring Security for role-based access (admin, employee, HR, etc.).

### **Phase 3: Core Features Development**

- **Objective:** Develop the core features of the HRM system.
- **Tasks:**

1. **Employee Management:**
    
    - Employee creation, modification, viewing, and deletion.
    - Create a service for handling employee data with business logic (validation, constraints, etc.).
    - Implement pagination and sorting for employee records.
2. **Attendance Management:**
    
    - Develop check-in/check-out functionality.
    - Store attendance logs with timestamps.
    - Create reports for attendance summaries (daily, monthly).
3. **Leave Management:**
    
    - Leave request submission, approval, and tracking.
    - Develop endpoints to apply for leave, view remaining leaves, and manage leave requests by HR.
    - Automate leave status updates (approved/rejected).
4. **Payroll Management:**
    
    - Set up employee salary structure (basic, allowances, deductions).
    - Automate payroll calculations (salaries, overtime, taxes).
    - Generate pay slips for each employee.
5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    
    - Implement user roles (admin, HR manager, employee).
    - Apply access control for different roles (who can view/edit what).
    - Create a login system using JWT or OAuth2.
6. **Performance Evaluation:**
    
    - Create modules for employee self-appraisal and manager evaluations.
    - Generate evaluation reports and store data for historical records.

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features Development**

- **Objective:** Enhance the system with advanced functionalities for scalability and usability.
- **Tasks:**
    - **Notifications & Email Integration:**
        - Implement email notifications (e.g., leave status updates, payroll slips).
        - Configure SMTP integration for sending automated emails.
    - **Reports and Analytics:**
        - Create dashboards to view statistics like employee attendance, leave, and performance metrics.
        - Export functionality for reports (PDF, CSV).
    - **Document Management:**
        - Store and manage employee-related documents (resumes, offer letters, appraisal documents).
    - **Audit Logging:**
        - Track system actions for auditing purposes (who did what and when).

### **Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance**

- **Objective:** Ensure the application is robust, secure, and bug-free.
- **Tasks:**
    - **Unit Testing:** Write JUnit test cases for service layers and business logic.
    - **Integration Testing:** Write tests for controller endpoints using MockMVC.
    - **Security Testing:** Ensure the application is secure from common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, CSRF, XSS).
    - **Performance Testing:** Check for scalability and load balancing.

### **Phase 6: Frontend Integration**

- **Objective:** Build the user interface for the HRM system (optional if a separate team is handling this).
- **Tasks:**
    - **Frontend Development (Angular/React):** Build UI components for the HRM features.
    - **Integration with Backend:** Connect REST APIs with the frontend.
    - **Real-time Features:** Implement WebSocket-based real-time notifications for leaves and approvals.

### **Phase 7: Deployment**

- **Objective:** Deploy the application to a production-ready environment.
- **Tasks:**
    - **Dockerization:** Create Docker files for containerization.
    - **CI/CD Setup:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
    - **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy the application to AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
    - **Database Backup and Security:** Implement database backup strategies and encryption for sensitive data.

### **Phase 8: Maintenance and Support**

- **Objective:** Provide post-deployment support, updates, and patches.
- **Tasks:**
    - **Bug Fixes and Improvements:** Address issues based on user feedback.
    - **Versioning:** Implement version control for new features and patches.
    - **Scalability:** Optimize performance based on usage patterns.

### **Phase 9: Future Enhancements**

- **Objective:** Add optional future features based on business needs.
- **Potential Features:**
    - **Mobile App Support:** Create a mobile version using Ionic or React Native.
    - **Integration with Third-Party Systems:** Integrate with payroll software, tax calculation APIs, etc.
    - **Employee Self-Service Portal:** Allow employees to view payslips, apply for leaves, and update personal information.
    - **Machine Learning for Analytics:** Use predictive analytics for performance evaluations or churn predictions.
